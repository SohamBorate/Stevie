A Discord Bot template

## Why this repository exists
I was working on a Discord bot, and just went
"This is the best architecture I have ever designed"
and just made sure it's safely stored on GitHub.

Template simplifies adding commands, as well
as controlling the bot from a dedicated server, what
I like to call as `Command and Control` server.
